**Refinery** is a map extractor for games utilizing Bungie's Blam engine, capable of decompiling map data to tags and raw data alike. It cannot however recompile maps.

Included as a part of Mozz Editing Kit Essentials, the version featured there also includes a GUI.

**#Views**
Refinery has three modes of sorting and displaying map data:

* Hierarchy view - this view shows the data as it is stored within maps. It's basically sorted into folders that categorize all tags by what they are, e.g. sounds, vehicles, characters, etc.
* Class view - sorts all data by the class of each tag e.g. bitmaps.
* Hybrid view - sorts first by Class view and then by Hierarchy view.
